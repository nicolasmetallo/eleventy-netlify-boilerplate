## Hey there.

My name is Nicolás, and I’m a management consultant and freelance deep learning engineer currently based in New York.

I’m interested in designing business strategies that work and using data to build things that solve real-world problems. I'm also a Porteño, River Plate's fan, and food-lover.

You can also check what I [write](https://medium.com/@nicolas.metallo) and [code](https://github.com/nicolasmetallo).
