## Hey there.

My name is Nicolas, and I'm an engineer currently based out of Europe. My interests are around computer vision, urban tech, data science, and creating sustainable business models. I'm also a Porte√±o, River Plate's fan, and food-lover.

I'm looking to turn this blank canvas into something that will be filled with cool tech ideas and fun projects.
