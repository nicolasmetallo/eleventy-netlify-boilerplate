**Author's note:** Since this article was originally written, in May 2017, both Apple and Amazon have surpassed the $1T valuation.

# Abstract

When looking back at 2006 only one out of the top five largest public companies by market capitalization was related to technology. Ten years later, all of them are. To become the first trillion dollar company will require both being a dominant player in their market and have a massive new market opportunity to grow into. This paper analyses the reasons why, even among other tech giants of this era, Amazon will most likely be the first company to ever achieve this mark by perfecting their Marketing Strategy to become the “go-to” place for all of our purchases (online and offline) by bringing together not only price, quality and convenience, but also the possibility to aspire to something more.

# COMPANY OVERVIEW
Amazon is an internet company that serves many industries such as Retail (Amazon Marketplace, Go, Prime, Essentials, Fashion), Cloud Infrastructure (Amazon Web Services, Business), Video Streaming (Amazon Prime Video), Advertisement (Amazon Advertisement) and Consumer Electronics (Amazon Kindle, Fire, Fire TV and Amazon Alexa devices). Amazon is the clear leader in e-commerce both in the US as globally, with revenues that reached $137B in 2016 (up 27% from 2015 earnings), by providing a personalized shopping experience, web-based credit card payment, and direct shipping to consumers (Bloomberg, 2017). Its subscription service has recently reached 80M users (Consumer Intelligence Report, 2017), which means that 63% of American Households (United States Census Bureau, 2016), mainly urban, younger and higher income, enjoy free and faster delivery and also music and video streaming services among other perks, which creates an attractive value proposition to consumers who are known to spend nearly twice as much as non-users with a 90% retention rate. (Consumer Intelligence Report, 2016)

Amazon is set out to become the **world’s marketplace** by holding true to its original mission statement, which is to be *“.. Earth’s most customer-centric company .. where consumers can find anything they want to buy online and at the lowest price”* (Amazon.com).

# MARKETING OBJECTIVES
Amazon’s first objective is to be completely focused on providing superior customer satisfaction. Many strategic decisions were misunderstood at first or seen with caution by shareholders as Amazon deployed an extensive distribution infrastructure to ensure cheaper and faster delivery to consumers. But even Jeff Bezos mentioned in a recent conference, “I don’t think anyone will ever want to spend more in shipping and have longer delivery times”. In the long run this played in their favor as it became the norm forcing every other company to try and offer the same benefits as Amazon, but without the access to the cheap capital that they have.

Amazon’s second objective is to be recognized as an “invention machine”, as characterized by its CEO in its annual letter to shareholders. Amazon has replaced profits with growth, and has a reputation to continuously test new markets that are not part of their core business. We can see that happening with their Prime Instant Video streaming service, where Amazon will spend $6B this year (2017) to produce original content, only second to Netflix whose whole core business is Video streaming.

# MARKETING MIX (4 PS)

### 1. PRODUCT
- Amazon’s marketplace has an extensive product line with more than 400M products currently available, from books to electronics to grocery items.
- Amazon offers several products within its line of consumer electronics, mainly Amazon Kindle, Fire, Fire TV, Dash, Echo, Dot, and most recently, Look.
- Prime Instant Video streaming services present itself as an alternative to Netflix delivering both original and non-original content to the consumer.
- Amazon Prime gives the user 2-day free shipping with unlimited access to movies and television, while also having other perks, like free ebooks each month.
- Amazon private label products that range from batteries (AmazonBasics), through household items (Amazon Elements) to fashion (Amazon Fashion).

### 2. PLACE/DISTRIBUTION
- Extensive distribution network across that consist of 240 fulfillment centres in the USA and 153 around the globe, bringing the total number to almost 400. (MWPVL, 2017). The last mile of the product delivery is normally done with UPS, USPS and FedEx in North America.
- Partnerships with transportation startups mainly in Europe to provide for the last mile, and even Amazon own attempts at Uber with Amazon Flex.

### 3. PROMOTION
#### 3.1 Advertisement
- Ads on television and print media
- Targeted ads based on browsing patterns
- Targeted email marketing
- Sales promotions like “Amazon Prime day”
#### 3.2 Public relations
#### 3.3 Direct marketing

### 4. PRICE
- Pricing algorithm that continuously checks prices with other online stores to ensure that Amazon has the best price. May be possibly biased towards giving higher positioning to companies that are enrolled in their Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program. (ProPublica, 2016)


# MARKETING STRATEGY
One interesting point about Amazon customer segmentation is that it’s not based on questions about where you are from or even your lifestyle, it’s based on actual purchase behaviour from the consumer. Each time you search or view an item, Amazon will show you related products that other consumers have purchased, refining its algorithm from each interaction or purchase you make. One may also say that this way when we consider people who purchased the same book, we may find a common pattern among that audience about their income, education and age. There are three key behavioral segmentation used by Amazon:

#### Loyalty status
- Measure browsing patterns and purchasing history

#### Buyer readiness stage
- Ability to create a wishlist, and add items to cart later
- Measure communication strategy performance to move the consumer to the actual purchase

#### User status
- Send notifications to users (product availability, complaints, deliveries, etc)

In Amazon’s marketplace, every consumer sees a different home page that’s tailored specifically to them, meaning that Amazon understands exactly how they spent their money yesterday, today and how they may do it tomorrow. When we add the fact that Amazon Alexa knows what type of questions you ask and what items you only order through that device (everyday items), it may develop in the future an AI that would suggest purchases based on your previous history. According to reports from L2Inc (2016), only 3 to 5% of the shopping we do is actually enjoyable, so creating a powerful algorithm that understands and knows your needs almost perfectly can take the pain of “boring” purchases away from you and become a huge success.

This type of dynamic segmentation is different to segmentation normally done by marketers, being based in reality rather than some prediction taking a small sample of people and making guesses about their purchasing behaviour. Amazon has been dedicated to track every interaction that the consumer does in their website and improve their search algorithm each time you make a new purchase, marginally altering the recommendations that another user will see.

# MARKETING CAMPAIGNS
### AMAZON PRIME DAY
On its first year in existence, Amazon Prime Day showed more sales than on its previous Black Friday, which was already a record in itself. There was also a 60% increase in last year Prime Day when compared to 2015. This shows the tremendous success that Amazon has had in what many called the biggest day for online retailers.

With 80 million Amazon Prime subscribers already signed up on the platform, the cost of acquisition of new members is not small, and Amazon does a great job showcasing the benefits of its monthly or yearly subscription service. They have basically chosen a day outside of the sales season and have created a tremendous amount of buzz around it, driving twice more traffic on a single day than Walmart, Target and Ebay combined. (Digital Commerce, 2016)

### AMAZON FASHION
There’s one category within Amazon marketplace that has seen tremendous growth during the last few years: Apparel. Amazon has been investing these last few years to reinvent itself as the next fashion destination for consumers and many brands are taking advantage of its distribution infrastructure and huge customer base. Its move into the fashion industry involves the creation of its own private fashion label called Amazon Fashion with seven in-house brands, and the fact that by 2017 they will become the largest clothing retailer in the US. (Quartz, 2016).

Amazon Fashion has taken off by placing top agencies working on ads for television and the internet. Response from the public is good but Amazon private label remains still unknown to most, and more marketing efforts should be undertaken. (Gott, 2016)

### AMAZON IN INDIA
The Indian e-commerce market is very different than the USA, with its young (65% under the age of 35) and rural population (67% live in rural areas). Infrastructure is lacking, most of the retail is handled by small mom-and-pop shops, and there are regulations against FDI that can jeopardize Indian retailers. Amazon had to understandably change their business model in order to meet the demands of the Indian market and that explains why, since the moment they set foot in India, they established a Glocal strategy of adapting their value proposition to the local particularities of the place where they will be established. (HBR, 2016)

Amazon marketing campaign started with the ad “Aur Dikhao Aur Dikhao” (See Exhibit 1), where they show how much value can the platform and its simplicity bring to everyday situations. Then it continued with “Kya Pehnu Kya Pehnu” (See Exhibit 2) that showed an Indian girl who cannot decide what to wear to go out with their friends. And finally, they aired “ek baar Amazon try toh kar” (See Exhibit 3) with the objective to demonstrate that there’s an easy return policy for customers in case they are not satisfied, targeting specifically the fear of change that Indian have.

With these and more campaigns, Amazon was able to focus on some idiosyncrasies of Indian society and present itself as an appealing option to Flipkart.

# AMAZON’S FUTURE
Amazon has been the biggest disruptor in retail in the last 100 years, and has established new paradigms among the industry. For example, when we think about retailers that have low or discounted prices as a main part of their value proposition, we think about a retailer that attracts lower income consumers, but in the case of Amazon we find the opposite with younger and wealthier consumers using the platform. Not only that, but Amazon has also trained stakeholders not to expect profits but rely on growth and vision. This played a big part on the tech environment as other companies have also seen an increase in their valuation even when operating at a loss (Uber, Snap, etc), with investors now more satisfied with high growth and vision rather than slower growth but profitable.

Amazon is slowly eroding the price premium that consumers have to pay when they purchase a product that has a long established brand. Normally it’s easier to get a good product at a very expensive price as you don’t want to do the market research across all other products. Brands charge a premium for that weight lift off from the consumer through their consistency and advertisement in packaging, in-store promotions and shelf space. Amazon is changing that by using its billion product reviews plus consumer purchasing behaviours to create a positioning algorithm that will show consumers products based on the preferences, the product price and its ratings effectively eliminating that brand premium. In the end, brands that benefit from this algorithm are trending independent brands that get great reviews and a big push towards the top, or good brands that have a sale or promotion on that particular day.

When looking at recent developments in speech recognition and natural language, Google and Amazon appear as clear winners. With the introduction of Google Home and Amazon Alexa, we can foresee how much less important traditional brand building will become, because when I say “buy batteries”, Amazon will offer me its best option, be it their own private label or one where they’d make the biggest margin. Brands will need to create better products or improve their value proposition if they want to compete with new and trendy independent offerings.

With the recent launch of Amazon Look, a smart camera combined with Alexa, data collection will be immense. Amazon will now have a massive training dataset about what people wear and how they combine their apparel in an intent to provide an unique value proposition for Amazon Fashion through technology. It’s important to mention that with Prime Instant Video, Amazon uses machine learning to recognize which actor is currently on the screen. Mixing that algorithm with one that understand apparel will open a new channel for Amazon, when people watch a movie and start asking Alexa, “Place an order for what she’s wearing”.

# RECOMMENDATIONS
Amazon should become an aspirational brand where consumers won’t have to make their purchases anywhere else. Everyday items would be purchased through Dash or Echo and that 3 to 5% of purchases we actually enjoy, should be made on top-notch brick-and-mortar stores by Amazon, where only 5+ star rating products should be. Once their Amazon Prime members share more of their data (Echo, Look), they would create better machine learning algorithms with a momentum that no other tech company would be able to counter. Marketing efforts should be focused on building brand equity and Fashion is an efficient way to do it while also trying to get into the luxury market.
